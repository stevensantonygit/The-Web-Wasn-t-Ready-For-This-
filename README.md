The Web Wasn't Ready For This - Day 1 Today marks the first release of "The Web Wasn't Ready For This" - my ongoing experiment in creating the most chaotic, frustrating web experience possible. Feature # 1: The Impossible Button I've added what appears to be a simple button with a simple task: click it. But this button has other ideas. It actively avoids your cursor, flees when you get close, and taunts you with increasingly dismissive insults every time you miss. Technical Details: The button detects when your cursor comes within 150px and immediately relocates Each failed click triggers a random insult that appears at your cursor position After 50 attempts, the button becomes even more erratic by removing transition animations If you somehow manage to click it (yes, it's technically possible), the entire page celebrates your victory with a spinning animation You can see the demo video at: https://github.com/stevensantonygit/The-Web-Wasn-t-Ready-For-This-/blob/main/The%20Web%20Wasn't%20Ready%20For%20This%20-%20Day%201%20.mp4 (Click view raw file to download the video!) Try It Yourself: Is your mouse accuracy up to the challenge? Can you outsmart a button that's programmed to hate you? Visit the site and find out! Fair warning: you may question your life choices after attempt # 37. What's Next? Tomorrow I'll be adding another "feature" that pushes web usability even further into the abyss. Stay tuned for more digital chaos as this journey into madness continues. Remember - this isn't a helpful website. This isn't a beautiful website. This is a journey. And the web... well, the web wasn't ready for this.----
