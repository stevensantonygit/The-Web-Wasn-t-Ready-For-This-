The Web Wasn't Ready For This - Day 1 
Today marks the first release of "The Web Wasn't Ready For This" - my ongoing experiment in creating the most chaotic, frustrating web experience possible. 
Feature # 1: The Impossible Button I've added what appears to be a simple button with a simple task: click it. But this button has other ideas. It actively avoids your cursor, flees when you get close, and taunts you with increasingly dismissive insults every time you miss. 
Technical Details: The button detects when your cursor comes within 150px and immediately relocates Each failed click triggers a random insult that appears at your cursor position After 50 attempts, the button becomes even more erratic by removing transition animations If you somehow manage to click it (yes, it's technically possible), the entire page celebrates your victory with a spinning animation.
You can see the demo video at: https://github.com/stevensantonygit/The-Web-Wasn-t-Ready-For-This-/blob/main/The%20Web%20Wasn't%20Ready%20For%20This%20-%20Day%201%20.mp4 (Click view raw file to download the video!) Try It Yourself: Is your mouse accuracy up to the challenge? Can you outsmart a button that's programmed to hate you? Visit the site and find out! Fair warning: you may question your life choices after attempt # 37. What's Next? Tomorrow I'll be adding another "feature" that pushes web usability even further into the abyss. Stay tuned for more digital chaos as this journey into madness continues. Remember - this isn't a helpful website. This isn't a beautiful website. This is a journey. And the web... well, the web wasn't ready for this.----


The Web Wasn't Ready For This - Day 2
Feature #2: Text That Runs Away
Today I'm excited to release the second feature in my ongoing exploration of digital chaos: text that actively resists being read!
Ever been frustrated by those annoying cookie popups or newsletter modals? That's nothing compared to paragraphs that literally flee from your cursor. Today's update brings you content that desperately doesn't want to be consumed.
Technical Details:
Each paragraph monitors your cursor's proximity and speed
When your cursor comes within 200px of text, it scatters in the opposite direction
The faster you move your mouse, the more frantically the text runs away
Text opacity decreases with cursor speed, making it harder to read when chased
Some paragraphs are more "skittish" than others for unpredictable behavior
The Secret:
There's actually a way to "tame" the wild text. I've hidden a little easter egg for the patient users who discover the trick. (Hint: Sometimes the best way to catch something isn't to chase it...)
Accessibility Note:
This feature is intentionally inaccessible. If you genuinely need to read the content, please realize that this entire project is an exercise in terrible UX design and not meant for practical use. That's kind of the point!
What's Next?
Tomorrow brings Day 3: "Form From Hell" - a sign-up experience that will test the limits of your sanity. Fields that rearrange while typing, password requirements that change every 5 seconds, and a submit button with perpetual loading anxiety!
Remember, this isn't a helpful website. This isn't a beautiful website. This is a journey into digital madness. And the web... well, the web wasn't ready for this.
